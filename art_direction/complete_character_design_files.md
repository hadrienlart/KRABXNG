## Quick Setup Instructions

**To use these files:**

1. **Copy each markdown section** from the artifacts I created
2. **Create the folder structure** as shown above in your GitHub repository
3. **Save each file** with the exact filename shown
4. **Commit and push** to your repository

**Alternative method:** I can provide you with individual downloadable artifacts for each file if you'd prefer to download them one by one rather than copy-paste. Each artifact I created earlier can be downloaded individually using the download button in the artifact interface.

Would you like me to break these down into individual downloadable artifacts, or does the copy-paste approach work better for your workflow?
