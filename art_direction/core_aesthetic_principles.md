# Core Aesthetic Principles

## Pixel Art Foundation

### Technical Standards
- **Base Resolution**: 320x240 (4:3 aspect ratio maintaining classic arcade proportions)
- **Scaling**: 2x-4x integer scaling for modern displays (avoiding pixel blur)
- **Color Depth**: 16-bit palette (65,536 colors) for rich gradients while maintaining retro authenticity
- **Frame Rate**: 60fps gameplay, 30fps for ambient animations, 15fps for background elements

### Animation Framework
- **Character Movement**: 8-12 frames for fluid motion without bloat
- **Combat Actions**: 6-16 frames based on technique complexity
- **Environmental Elements**: 4-6 frames for ambient life (steam, smoke, flags)
- **UI Transitions**: 3-4 frames for responsive interface feedback

### Dithering Philosophy
**Strategic Application**: Not blanket retro-nostalgia, but purposeful texture creation
- **Distance Fog**: Atmospheric depth in long soi corridors  
- **Material Simulation**: Concrete texture, weathered wood grain
- **Lighting Transitions**: Dawn/dusk color blending, neon light falloff
- **Spiritual Effects**: Karma aura gradients, incense smoke dissipation

## Cultural Visual Language

### Thai Architectural Elements
**Traditional Forms**:
- **Chofah**: Pointed roof finials (stylized bird/naga shapes)
- **Prang**: Central spire towers with geometric stepping
- **Mondop**: Square pavilions with pyramidal roofs
- **Viharn**: Assembly halls with distinctive Thai roof curves

**Urban Adaptations**:
- Shophouse narrow frontages with traditional upper elements
- Modern buildings incorporating traditional rooflines
- Commercial signage respecting/subverting sacred geometries
- Concrete structures with Thai decorative insertions

### Buddhist Iconography Integration
**Sacred Geometry**:
- **Dharma Wheel**: 8-spoked circles representing Noble Eightfold Path
- **Lotus Patterns**: Unfolding petals showing spiritual development
- **Endless Knots**: Interconnected loops representing karmic interdependence
- **Stupa Forms**: Bell curves and square bases showing cosmic order

**Pixel Adaptation Rules**:
- Maintain proportional relationships despite low resolution
- Simplify details while preserving symbolic meaning
- Use color coding for different spiritual significance levels
- Ensure readability at both native and scaled resolutions

### Urban Thai Signage Systems
**Typography Mixing**:
- Vertical Thai script maintaining traditional reading flow
- English text integration without cultural dominance
- Size hierarchy respecting both linguistic systems
- Neon bleeding effects creating visual unity

**Commercial Visual Language**:
- Plastic banner materials (vibrant, slightly artificial colors)
- Hand-painted shop signs (imperfect but characterful lettering)
- LED displays (harsh pixel matrices contrasting organic forms)
- Motorcycle taxi vests (numbered identification systems)

### Street Level Environmental Details
**Living City Elements**:
- **Motorcycle Exhaust**: Particle streams showing traffic flow and urban density
- **Vendor Steam**: Rising from cooking surfaces, creating atmospheric depth
- **Incense Smoke**: Spiral patterns connecting earth to sky, sacred to mundane
- **Laundry Lines**: Colorful fabric geometry breaking architectural rigidity

**Material Authenticity**:
- **Corrugated Metal**: Rust patterns, weather staining, structural honesty  
- **Concrete**: Staining, cracking, urban weathering patterns
- **Plastic Tarps**: Bright colors, translucency effects, temporary architecture
- **Wood**: Tropical weathering, traditional joinery details, sacred carving fragments

## Aesthetic Hierarchy System

### Visual Priority Levels
**Primary Focus** (Maximum detail, highest contrast):
- Protagonist and krabong
- Active combat participants
- Interactive environmental elements
- Critical narrative objects

**Secondary Elements** (Supporting detail, medium contrast):
- Background NPCs with gameplay relevance
- Architectural features defining space
- Ambient lighting effects
- Cultural/religious symbols

**Tertiary Background** (Atmospheric detail, low contrast):
- Distant architecture and traffic
- Weather effects and ambient particles
- Decorative elements without mechanical function
- Historical/cultural context details

### Contrast Management
**Gameplay Clarity**: Essential elements must remain readable regardless of aesthetic complexity
**Cultural Depth**: Background details provide authenticity without distraction
**Atmospheric Unity**: All elements share color temperature and lighting logic

## Technical Artistic Constraints

### Sprite Optimization
**Memory Management**:
- Shared color palettes across related sprites
- Modular component systems for character customization
- Efficient sprite sheet packing for loading performance
- LOD (Level of Detail) systems for distant objects

**Animation Efficiency**:
- Shared keyframes between similar movements
- Interpolation techniques for smooth motion
- Minimal frame counts while maintaining fluidity
- Strategic frame skipping for performance scaling

### Performance Considerations
**Target Specifications**:
- 60fps on mid-range hardware (5-year-old gaming laptops)
- Maximum 32 sprites simultaneously on screen
- 4 parallax background layers without performance drop
- Real-time lighting effects limited to essential gameplay moments
