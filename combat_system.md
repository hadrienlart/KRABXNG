# Combat System

## Krabong-Based Fighting Mechanics

### Sacred Geometry in Combat
- **Circular Strikes**: Representing karmic cycles, good for crowd control
- **Angular Deflections**: Breaking negative patterns, defensive counters  
- **Linear Thrusts**: Direct action with clear intent, precision attacks

### Mathematical Progression
- **Early Game**: Raw, instinctual swinging - basic attacks, survival focus
- **Mid Game**: Learning patterns and rhythm - combo chains, defensive options
- **Late Game**: Precise, mindful combat - advanced techniques, spiritual integration

## Dual Combat Styles

### White Karma Techniques (Protective/Defensive)
**Philosophy**: Protection and mercy, minimum necessary force

**Moves:**
- **Guardian's Circle**: Defensive stance deflecting multiple attacks
- **Compassionate Strike**: Non-lethal takedown preserving enemy life
- **Protective Barrier**: Krabong spins creating energy shield
- **Mercy's End**: Finishing move that spares defeated enemies

**Benefits:**
- Enhanced defense and damage reduction
- Faster health regeneration during combat
- Ally assistance from benevolent spirits
- Environmental help (vendors, NPCs)

### Black Karma Techniques (Aggressive/Brutal)
**Philosophy**: Necessary violence, eye-for-eye justice

**Moves:**
- **Asura's Fury**: Berserker combo chain with increasing damage
- **Bone Breaker**: Devastating single strike with permanent damage
- **Fear Harvest**: Intimidation effects causing enemy paralysis
- **Vengeance Spiral**: Each kill increases power for next attack

**Benefits:**
- Significantly increased damage output
- Fear effects on remaining enemies
- Access to environmental hazards as weapons
- Corrupted spirit assistance

## Hybrid Balance Techniques
**Philosophy**: Middle Way - enlightened action requiring both karma types

### Advanced Combinations
- **Bodhisattva's Judgment**: Protective setup → Necessary force → Merciful conclusion
- **Dharma Enforcement**: Reading enemy intent → Precise intervention → Karmic balance
- **Sacred Warrior**: Traditional forms with situational adaptation

### Requirements
- Specific karma balance ratios
- Mastery of both white and black fundamentals
- Temple training from multiple sources
- Spiritual development milestones

## Enemy AI and Karma Response

### Enemy Types and Reactions

#### Street Thugs
- **Low karma sensitivity**: Fight regardless of protagonist's spiritual state
- **Intimidation susceptible**: Black karma techniques cause fear/retreat
- **Community influenced**: White karma brings vendor/civilian assistance

#### Corrupted Officials  
- **Karma aware**: Recognize spiritual power and adjust tactics
- **Respect strength**: Black karma gains grudging respect
- **Fear purity**: White karma threatens their corrupt foundation

#### Spiritual Entities
- **Highly karma sensitive**: Completely different behavior based on alignment
- **White karma**: Benevolent spirits assist, hostile ones become neutral
- **Black karma**: Malevolent spirits aid, protective ones become aggressive

## Environmental Combat Integration

### Urban Soi Battlegrounds
- **Narrow spaces**: Krabong effectiveness in confined areas
- **Vendor stalls**: Improvised weapons and obstacles
- **Motorcycle traffic**: Timing-based hazards and opportunities
- **Neon signs**: Electrical environmental hazards

### Temple Grounds
- **Sacred space effects**: Some techniques enhanced/diminished
- **Guardian statue activation**: Environmental allies based on karma
- **Incense smoke**: Vision obscurance and spiritual energy
- **Prayer bell timing**: Rhythm-based combo opportunities

## Progression and Unlocks

### Skill Trees Based on Sources

#### Street Knowledge (Vendor-taught)
- Improvised weapon usage
- Urban environment exploitation  
- Quick escape and navigation
- Dirty fighting techniques

#### Temple Wisdom (Monk-taught)
- Traditional krabong forms
- Spiritual energy manipulation
- Meditation-enhanced combat focus
- Protective spiritual techniques

#### Family Heritage (Brother/Spirit-taught)
- Ancestral fighting styles
- Emotional regulation in combat
- Family-specific techniques
- Memories-triggered power moves

### Unlock Mechanisms
- **Combat Practice**: Repetition and successful application
- **Spiritual Development**: Temple visits and karma balance
- **Story Progression**: Key narrative moments and revelations
- **Environmental Discovery**: Hidden teachers and secret techniques

## Special Mechanics

### Karma Resonance
- **Same-aligned enemies**: Reduced damage taken/given
- **Opposite-aligned enemies**: Increased damage multipliers
- **Neutral enemies**: Standard combat interactions

### Spiritual Exhaustion
- **Overuse of any extreme**: Temporary karma lock preventing further alignment
- **Recovery**: Meditation, rest, or balanced action required
- **Consequences**: Reduced spiritual abilities until balance restored

### Environmental Karma
- **Locations remember**: Areas affected by player's karmic choices
- **Persistent effects**: Previous actions influence future encounters
- **Community memory**: NPCs remember and react to past behavior

## Boss Design Philosophy

### Early Bosses: Pure Opposition
- **Street Lords**: Pure black karma, requiring white techniques to overcome
- **Corrupt Officials**: Mixed karma, requiring tactical adaptation

### Mid Bosses: Mirror Matches  
- **Fallen Temple Guards**: Corrupted versions of player's potential path
- **Revenge Seekers**: Characters following similar but unopposed journey

### Final Bosses: Perfect Balance Required
- **Criminal Mastermind**: Requires both protective and aggressive approaches
- **Corrupted Monk**: Understanding both paths to find resolution
- **Inner Demon**: Literal fight against karmic imbalance
