# Karma System

## Core Philosophy

**Balance, not purity** - The protagonist cannot fight violence with pure kindness, but she can find balance between necessary action and spiritual cultivation.

## Dual Karma Tracks

### White Karma (Kusala Kamma)
**Sources:**
- Protecting innocents
- Showing mercy to defeated enemies
- Temple meditation and offerings
- Helping street vendors and community
- Non-violent problem solving

**Benefits:**
- Enhanced perception (enemy telegraphs, hidden paths)
- Faster health regeneration
- Access to protective techniques
- Spiritual ally assistance

### Black Karma (Akusala Kamma)  
**Sources:**
- Excessive violence beyond necessity
- Using corrupted temple techniques
- Choosing vengeance over justice
- Harming innocents or neutral parties
- Ignoring opportunities for mercy

**Benefits:**
- Increased damage output
- Access to brutal finishing moves
- Fear effects on enemies
- Corrupted power techniques

## Balance Mechanics

### Combo Requirements
- Advanced techniques require **both** karma types
- **Protective strikes** (white) enable **finishing brutality** (black)
- **Compassionate setup** → **Necessary force** → **Karmic completion**

### Dynamic Interactions
- **Pure White**: High defense, low damage, spiritual abilities
- **Pure Black**: High damage, low defense, fear/rage abilities  
- **Balanced**: Access to most powerful hybrid techniques

### Karma Consequences

#### Environmental Responses
- **White-heavy**: Temple monks welcome, spirits assist, vendors offer help
- **Black-heavy**: Corrupted monks respect, aggressive spirits appear, some NPCs flee
- **Balanced**: Universal respect but occasional suspicion

#### Combat Modifications
- **White techniques** may heal enemies instead of killing (choice moments)
- **Black techniques** leave karmic "stains" that attract vengeful spirits
- **Balance** allows "clean kills" - ending suffering without generating negative karma

## Progression Gates

### Temple Access
- **City Temples**: Accept any karma level (corrupted monks understand necessity)
- **Mountain Temples**: Require karma balance or white-heavy alignment
- **Ancient Temples**: Only accessible with perfect balance

### Special Moves
- **Asura Arts**: Black karma exclusive, brutally effective but spiritually costly
- **Bodhisattva Forms**: White karma exclusive, protective and healing
- **Middle Way**: Balance-only techniques representing enlightened action

## Narrative Integration

### Internal Monologue
Karma level affects protagonist's self-reflection:
- **"I'm becoming like them..."** (black-heavy)
- **"Am I strong enough to protect anyone?"** (white-heavy)  
- **"This is the only way forward."** (balanced)

### Story Branches
- Multiple endings based on final karma alignment
- NPC reactions change throughout game
- Different final boss strategies required

## Mathematical Model

```
Total Karma = White Karma - Black Karma
Balance Score = 100 - |White Karma - Black Karma|

Optimal Range: Balance Score > 70
Critical Imbalance: Balance Score < 30
```
